## 
The game uses a selection of 21 cards out of a standard deck.
These are shuffled and the player selects one at random. 
The cards are then dealt out face up in three columns of 7 cards each. 
The player points to the column containing their card.
The cards are picked up and the process is repeated three times, at which point the magician reveals the selected card.

Hello welcome to 21 words game, this game derived from the card magic trick called "21 cards trick".
I spent my dying life hours to put the card trick algorithm into a piece of code,
and then i spent countless hours debugging so that the algorithmn guesses the correct word that 
you have chosen and remembered through your mind.

This algorithm is a implementation of STACK ALGO.
